      <h1>Early Security Interest</h1>
      <p>My cybersecurity journey began at age 5 with console modding, specifically the Xbox 360. I discovered JTAG modifications, cold booting, and the fascinating world of custom firmware. This hands-on experience taught me about secure boot processes, hardware encryption, and the delicate balance between system security and user access. I learned that even seemingly secure systems could have vulnerabilities in their implementation.</p>

      <h1>Security Evolution</h1>
      <p>Throughout my teenage years, I witnessed the transformation of security paradigms. From basic WEP encryption to WPA3, from simple password systems to complex multi-factor authentication. I became particularly intrigued by zero-day exploits and their impact on system security. This led me to study advanced concepts like buffer overflow attacks, SQL injection prevention, and secure coding practices. The emergence of quantum computing threats to current cryptographic standards especially caught my attention.</p>

      <h1>Academic Focus</h1>
      <p>My Computer Science studies emphasize practical security applications. I'm deep-diving into asymmetric cryptography, particularly elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and its implementation in modern systems. My research includes exploring post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, analyzing advanced persistent threats (APTs), and developing machine learning models for intrusion detection systems. I regularly participate in CTF competitions to sharpen my skills in real-world scenarios.</p>

      <h1>Security Philosophy</h1>
      <p>I advocate for a defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple security layers with continuous security testing. My methodology involves implementing zero-trust architectures, conducting regular threat modeling sessions, and maintaining robust incident response plans. I'm particularly interested in blockchain security and smart contract auditing, as these technologies represent the next frontier in secure systems. Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical security concepts and their practical implementation.</p>
